# Jenkins

Base directory to store Jenkins downloads scripts and config files

## What do we download from Jenkins -- http://updates.jenkins-ci.org/download/war?

We download the **jenkins.war ** file for the specified release line verion

## Upgrades Frequency

According to Jenkins site (https://jenkins.io/download/lts/) , 
The weekly Jenkins releases deliver bug fixes and new features rapidly to users 
and plugin developers who need them. But for more conservative users, itâ€™s preferable to stick to a release line which 
changes less often and only receives important bug fixes, even if such a release line lags behind in terms of features.

We run the upgrades on demand - meaning whenever the "Manage Jenkins" window shows
a new release alert on our Jenkins server, we toggle an upgrade

See : https://jenkins.mdibl.org/manage

Runs: On demand
