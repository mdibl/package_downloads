Hisat2:

HISAT2 is a successor to both HISAT and TopHat2. It's recommended that the HISAT and TopHat2 users switch to HISAT2. A fast and sensitive spliced alignment program for mapping RNA-seq reads. In addition to one global FM index that represents a whole genome, HISAT uses a large set of small FM indexes that collectively cover the whole genome (each index represents a genomic region of ~64,000 bp and ~48,000 indexes are needed to cover the human genome).
