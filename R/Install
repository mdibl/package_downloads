# This script is called by the main install script 
# (install_package.sh)  to build and install 
# a new version of the package 
#
# What it does:
# 1) source the main config file to set global path
# 2) untar the downloaded tar file
# 3) builds and install R
#
# Note: the following environment variables are expected to be set
# by the caller
# 1) GLOBAL_CONFIG
# 2) PACKAGE_BASE
# 3) PACKAGE_DEPENDENCIES_FILE
