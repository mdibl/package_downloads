## Obtaining Salmon

Once youâ€™ve downloaded the appropriate binary (e.g. Salmon-0.8.1_linux_x86_64.tar.gz for a 64-bit Linux system), you simply decompress it like so:

```
 tar xzvf Salmon-0.8.1_linux_x86_64.tar.gz
```

The binary will be located in the bin directory inside of the uncompressed folder; 
for example Salmon-0.8.1_linux_x86_64/bin/salmon in the example above. 

You can either run salmon directly using the full path, or place it into your PATH variable for easier execution.
